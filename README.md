# annotated_research_papers

![Alt Text](image/papers.gif)
Do you love reading research papers? I spend a lot of my time reading papers. I think it is a very crucial part of my ML work. 
I am a pen-paper guy, but because of the ongoing scenarios, I am not able to print the papers. Hence, I will be sharing all 
the annotated research papers in this repo.
