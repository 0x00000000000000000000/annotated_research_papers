# annotated_research_papers

Do you love reading research papers? I spend a lot of my time reading papers as I think it is very crucial part of my ML
work. I am a pen-paper guy but becuase of on the ongoing scenarions, I am not able to print the papers. Hence, I will be 
sharing all the annotated papers in this repo.
